## 1. Basics

### Qbit
- A qbit is the basic unit of quantum information, like a bit but can exist in superposition of 0 and 1 states. It's a vector with unit length in complex space.

### Superposition
- Superposition allows a qbit to be in multiple states (like 0 and 1) at once until measured, enabling parallel computation.

### Entanglement
- Entanglement links multiple qbits so their states are correlated and can't be described independently, even at a distance.
